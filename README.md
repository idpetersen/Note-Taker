[For more information on installing npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-install)

[For more information on installing nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)

The user will then need to open the main directory in the integrated terminal and run the command `npm i` to install the neccessary dependancies for the application to run.
Then to start the application, the user will need to run `nodemon server.js` in the terminal. 


## Usage

The user will have the option to use the application VIA the [deployed site](https://floating-basin-40721.herokuapp.com/), or by installing it locally on their machine. 

- After running `nodemon index.js` the user will need to open a web application and enter `localhost:3001` in the url input.

- Upon pressing the enter key, the user will be prompted with the home page. On the home page, the user has to click "Get Started" to start entering notes.

- The user will have the ability to either enter a new note, look at an old note, or delete a note.

- To add a new note, the user has to click on the + button located on the upper right corner. After doing so, the place holder text "Note title" and "Note text" will appear. The user has to enter text in both fields to be able to save the note. 

- After entering text in both fields, the user can save a note by pressing the newly populated save button üíæ located in the upper right corner to left of the "+" button. The newly saved note will appear on the left side of the application's page. The user can then access that note by clicking on it and that note will populate it's text in the same area they typed in.

- The user will also have the ability to edit a note by clicking on the note they would like to edit and editing it's text. Upon saving the edited note, a new note will appear with the edited changes.

- To delete a note, the user needs to click on the üóëÔ∏è button. The note will then be deleted from the database.
